Rubik's void cube designed for high school graduation project

Please Read All The Way Through


Hello, My Name is Foley. 

these models you are looking at are a piece of my High School Graduation Project. We had to do something that we can relate to our topics.

My Topic was Hacking, and to capture what I see as the Hacker's ethic I wanted to do something communicative with the Internet Community, something open source. 

So I designed a Rubik's cube that you can hide a full flash drive in (after scaling the parts to fit the drive inside). as a basic template. Now I am releasing my design online as well as a few pictures I captured of the one that I 

did.

I'm hoping that the internet community takes the cube and adds to it. Redesigned it or just does something with it to keep the project growing and expanding as long as possible.

This really has been an awesome project to work on for me, introducing me to 3D modeling, 3D printing, I learned CAD (computer aided design (for those new to it))  and many other skills not offered at my school all on 

my own time and it was awesome I really feel like I accomplished something. Oops ranting, sorry 

If you take this design and use it for something awesome please send me a link to or the design you make at this email so I can see what you do with it and if you want to include your story of how you first entered CAD and 

or decided to build upon this community item. Iâ€™m also hoping that some of those who do email me give me permission to add what they did to the folder and show others what can be done and give even more ideas along 

with more stories of how/why people started CADing. If enough people take interest in this project I'll even start a blog in my freetime for this project and showcase all the creations people send me 

You can email me anything you make from this (or just plain cool things you make if you want) or any questions about what my goals are at thejestercube@gmail.com

p.s. I'm hoping to keep this project going even after I graduate and just keep making items for others to build off of.

Thank You For Your Time
